// There still is not a good free globe other than this... so I kicked it forward a notch including:
//
//   * moving it to flex builder
//   * fixing cross domain tiles
//   * making it addressable from javascript
//   * a number of small cosmetic cleanups

// Spinny Globe App
// Open Source / Free / Public Domain
// By Anselm Hook, Michael Gaio, Alain Bloch, Matthew Stadler, Stephanie Snyder, Paige Saez and others
// This work was funded by Meedan and Call2Action and MakerLab - thanks so much we love ya!
//
// The hope is to provide a 'good enough' minimalist 3d zoomable globe in flash that others can build on.
// Many people have written proprietary flash globes and the hope here is to reduce that duplicate effort.
//
// In general I've tried to generate the globe surface as a single polygon mesh to avoid slivers.
// The poles are not well dealt with and I avoid those cases by limiting the camera pan and zoom for now.
// In general there should be a 'pole cap' applied or a different rendering algorithm for the poles.
//
// The application also loads in XML content with markers and pop-up dialogs.  Line drawing is supported.
//
// There will hopefully be ongoing incremental improvements - see http://spinnyglobe.googlecode.com

// Bugs:
//
//  * polygons are not rendering in certain cases at zoom of 1 - this must be some kind of boundary failure. fixed.
//  * polar caps and slivers
//		* draw white or skip.
//		- a filler polar cap must be drawn? doesn't seem critical yet.
//		- i can still get slivers anyway; circumvented for now but should we unfold as we zoom or render more data?
//		- should we not be so aggressive about only rendering a 3 x 3 ?  if we allowed more (if cached) it may help
//	* remove arcball or apply constraint lock; fixed.
//	* navigation jumps at some zooms; this turns out to be an event handling bug in flash; fixed.
//	* button controls need to scale and a reset would be nice.  fixed.
//  * when you drag outside the screen and let go of the mouse it think the mouse is still down. fixed.
//  * the size of the globe has to be carefully chosen to avoid showing incomplete slivers. fixed.
//  * on a reset the manipulator zoom was not reset so it would drag at the wrong speed. fixed.
//	* draw lines
//	* draw map markers, map popups, load map data
//  * draw a logo
//	* the logo leads to an url that leads to the makerlab site
//  * click on a dot to close little dialog window as well as open it
//  * tie into georss
//	* cannot repeat zoom when you double click again and zoom again
//  * the description is not showing up in georss
//  x decluttering
//		* different zoom levels for data
//  ~ street level data
//  x make pop mode conditional
//  * start over portland oregon
//	- improve line elevation in some cases and think about crossing prime meridian
//	- double buffer by drawing two globes and switching after entirety has loaded
//  - motion momentum
//	- an animation sequencing engine for storytelling
//  - compile with flex to let more people participate in coding
//	- remoting for map data is failing - why???
//  - don't open a new window but try use the same window... this is a problem with an iframe
//  - double clicking is failing
//	- a way to toggle between popup and hover information
//	- the info is not revising the same window but instead is opening a new one... bad.
//
//  - server side map data generation strategy
//	    * mapnik builds
//	    - draw map data from open street maps using mapnik as a wms?
//	    - draw base data from mapserver
//	    - draw data behind tilecache
//
//  - server side unix issues on civicmaps.org:
//		- boost won't build so mapnik wont built and mapnik cannot find built in boost
//		- gdal 1.5 won't build due to weird error so bigtiff won't build - so mapserver too - a problem?
//		- could try all on meedan hardware i guess?
